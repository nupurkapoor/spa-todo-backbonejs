### Application Specific Notes

##### Architecture - higher level

**Requirements**
* a Todo model to describe individual todo items
 * Since the model is a place where we keep our data. So, our ToDos will simply be models.
* a TodoList collection to store and persist todos
* a way of creating todos
* a way to display * a listing of todos
* a way to edit existing todos
* a way to mark * a todo as completed
* a way to delete todos
* a way to filter the items that have been completed or are remaining

Nothing fancy all these features are classy CRUD methods!

##### Moving Along

* The app.js file is present to house central initialization code.
